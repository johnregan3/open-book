      "1": "The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw. \n",
      "10": "At kings they scoff,\n    and of rulers they make sport.\nThey laugh at every fortress\n    and heap up earth to take it.\n",
      "11": "Then they sweep by like the wind;\n    they transgress and become guilty;\n    their own might is their god! \n",
      "12": "Are you not from of old,\n    O Lord my God, my Holy One?\n    You shall not die.\nO Lord, you have marked them for judgment,\n    and you, O Rock, have established them for punishment.\n",
      "13": "Your eyes are too pure to behold evil,\n    and you cannot look on wrongdoing;\nwhy do you look on the treacherous\n    and are silent when the wicked swallow\n    those more righteous than they?\n",
      "14": "You have made people like the fish of the sea,\n    like crawling things that have no ruler. \n",
      "15": "He brings all of them up with a hook;\n    he drags them out with his net;\nhe gathers them in his seine,\n    so he rejoices and exults.\n",
      "16": "Therefore he sacrifices to his net\n    and makes offerings to his seine,\nfor by them his portion is lavish,\n    and his food is rich.\n",
      "17": "Is he then to keep on emptying his net\n    and destroying nations without mercy?",
      "2": "O Lord, how long shall I cry for help,\n    and you will not listen?\nOr cry to you \"Violence!\"\n    and you will not save?\n",
      "3": "Why do you make me see wrongdoing\n    and look at trouble?\nDestruction and violence are before me;\n    strife and contention arise.\n",
      "4": "So the law becomes slack,\n    and justice never prevails.\nThe wicked surround the righteous;\n    therefore judgment comes forth perverted. \n",
      "5": "Look at the nations and see!\n    Be astonished! Be astounded!\nFor a work is being done in your days\n    that you would not believe if you were told.\n",
      "6": "For I am rousing the Chaldeans,\n    that fierce and impetuous nation,\nwho march through the breadth of the earth\n    to seize dwellings not their own.\n",
      "7": "Dread and fearsome are they;\n    their justice and dignity proceed from themselves.\n",
      "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards,\n    more menacing than wolves at dusk;\n    their horses charge.\nTheir horsemen come from far away;\n    they fly like an eagle swift to devour.\n",
      "9": "They all come for violence,\n    with faces pressing forward;\n    they gather captives like sand.\n"

      "1": "I will stand at my watchpost\n    and station myself on the rampart;\nI will keep watch to see what he will say to me\n    and what he will answer concerning my complaint.\n",
      "10": "You have devised shame for your house\n    by cutting off many peoples;\n    you have forfeited your life.\n",
      "11": "The very stones will cry out from the wall,\n    and the rafter will respond from the woodwork. \n",
      "12": "\"Alas for you who build a town by bloodshed\n    and found a city on iniquity!\"\n",
      "13": "Is it not from the Lord of hosts\n    that peoples labor only to feed the flames\n    and nations weary themselves for nothing?\n",
      "14": "But the earth will be filled\n    with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\n    as the waters cover the sea. \n",
      "15": "\"Alas for you who make your neighbors drink,\n    pouring out your wrath until they are drunk,\n    in order to gaze on their nakedness!\"\n",
      "16": "You will be sated with contempt instead of glory.\n    Drink, you yourself, and stagger!\nThe cup in the Lord's right hand\n    will come around to you,\n    and shame will come upon your glory!\n",
      "17": "For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you;\n    the destruction of the animals will terrify you-\nbecause of human bloodshed and violence to the earth,\n    to cities and all who live in them. \n",
      "18": "What use is an idol\n    once its maker has shaped it-\n    a cast image, a teacher of lies?\nFor its maker trusts in what has been made,\n    though the product is only an idol that cannot speak!\n",
      "19": "Alas for you who say to the wood, \"Wake up!\"\n    to silent stone, \"Rouse yourself!\"\n    Can it teach?\nSee, it is gold and silver plated,\n    and there is no breath in it at all. \n",
      "2": "Then the Lord answered me and said:\nWrite the vision;\n    make it plain on tablets,\n    so that a runner may read it.\n",
      "20": "But the Lord is in his holy temple;\n    let all the earth keep silence before him!",
      "3": "For there is still a vision for the appointed time;\n    it speaks of the end and does not lie.\nIf it seems to tarry, wait for it;\n    it will surely come; it will not delay.\n",
      "4": "Look at the proud!\n    Their spirit is not right in them,\n    but the righteous live by their faithfulness.\n",
      "5": "Moreover, wealth is treacherous;\n    the arrogant do not endure.\nThey open their throats wide as Sheol;\n    like Death they never have enough.\nThey gather all nations for themselves\n    and collect all peoples as their own. \n",
      "6": "Shall not everyone taunt such people and, with mocking riddles, say about them,\n\"Alas for you who heap up what is not your own!\"\n    How long will you load yourselves with goods taken in pledge?\n",
      "7": "Will not your own creditors suddenly rise\n    and those who make you tremble wake up?\n    Then you will be plunder for them.\n",
      "8": "Because you have plundered many nations,\n    all who survive of the peoples shall plunder you-\nbecause of human bloodshed and violence to the earth,\n    to cities and all who live in them. \n",
      "9": "\"Alas for you who get evil gain for your house,\n    setting your nest on high\n    to be safe from the reach of harm!\"\n"

      "10": "The mountains saw you and writhed;\n    a torrent of water swept by;\nthe deep gave forth its voice.\n    The sun raised high its hands;\n",
      "11": "the moon stood still in its exalted place,\n    at the light of your arrows speeding by,\n    at the gleam of your flashing spear.\n",
      "12": "In fury you marched on the earth;\n    in anger you trampled nations.\n",
      "13": "You came forth to save your people,\n    to save your anointed.\nYou crushed the head of the wicked house,\n    laying it bare from foundation to roof. Selah\n",
      "14": "You pierced with their own arrows the head of his warriors,\n    who came like a whirlwind to scatter us,\n    gloating as if ready to devour the poor who were in hiding.\n",
      "15": "You trampled the sea with your horses,\n    churning the mighty waters. \n",
      "16": "I hear, and I tremble within;\n    my lips quiver at the sound.\nRottenness enters into my bones,\n    and my steps tremble beneath me.\nI wait quietly for the day of calamity\n    to come upon the people who attack us. \n",
      "17": "Though the fig tree does not blossom\n    and no fruit is on the vines;\nthough the produce of the olive fails\n    and the fields yield no food;\nthough the flock is cut off from the fold\n    and there is no herd in the stalls,\n",
      "18": "yet I will rejoice in the Lord;\n    I will exult in the God of my salvation.\n",
      "19": "God, the Lord, is my strength;\n    he makes my feet like the feet of a deer\n    and makes me tread upon the heights.\nTo the leader: with stringed instruments.",
      "2": "O Lord, I have heard of your renown,\n    and I stand in awe, O Lord, of your work.\nIn our own time revive it;\n    in our own time make it known;\n    in wrath may you remember mercy.\n",
      "3": "God came from Teman,\n    the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah\nHis glory covered the heavens,\n    and the earth was full of his praise.\n",
      "4": "The brightness was like the sun;\n    rays came forth from his hand,\n    where his power lay hidden.\n",
      "5": "Before him went pestilence,\n    and plague followed close behind.\n",
      "6": "He stopped and shook the earth;\n    he looked and made the nations tremble.\nThe eternal mountains were shattered;\n    along his ancient pathways\n    the everlasting hills sank low.\n",
      "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan under affliction;\n    the tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled.\n",
      "8": "Was your wrath against the rivers, O Lord,\n    or your anger against the rivers\n    or your rage against the sea,\nwhen you drove your horses,\n    your chariots to victory?\n",
      "9": "You brandished your naked bow;\n    sated were the arrows at your command. Selah\n    You split the earth with rivers.\n"
